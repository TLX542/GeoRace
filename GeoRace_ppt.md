Algorithmic calculation of a point accessible at equal distance for all

**03 - SIMULTANEOUS START**
Synchronized countdown after mutual acceptance

---

### 🟦 Slide 8 – A GeoRace duel

**Typical scenario:**

1. **You start your run** → the app detects 3 runners within 800m
2. **Duel proposal** → notification "Paul (ELO 1420) challenges you"
3. **You accept** → the system calculates a finish point at 1.2km for each
4. **Start in 10 seconds** → countdown
5. **Live race** → GPS guides you, opponent's position visible
6. **Finish** → +25 ELO, badge "5 consecutive victories" unlocked

---

### 🟦 Slide 9 – Quick demo (key points for presentation)

**Presentation script - Key points to emphasize**

* **Equidistant finish point**: "Each runner covers exactly the same distance - total fairness"
* **ELO Matchmaking**: "You always face someone at your level - neither too easy nor impossible"
* **Real-time duel**: "No after-the-fact comparison - it's a real race, now"
* **Security and privacy**: "Your position is only visible during active duels"
